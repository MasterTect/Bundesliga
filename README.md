# Bundesliga
Assignment1 for OOP 2015
Computer Science (International)

The CSV file contains the records of all games and their results in the
German Football League(Bundesliga) from 2000 to 2008.

I have manipulated this data so that it shows, total home goals scored,
total away goals scored and total goals scored in each year from 2000 to 2008.
It is a trend line graph that compares the amount of goals scored on home grounds and
on away grounds.
It clearly shows that every year, without fail, teams are much more succesful playing
on their home ground.
While total away goals scored each year seems to deviate slightly, total home goals scored
has a much bigger impact on the total number of goals scored within a given year.
This can be seen when you hover over the year '2002'. The slump in the trend line
for home goals scored(green line) is almost identical to the slump in total goals scored(blue line)
while away goals scored(red line) is at a plateau. 
This can be seen in the screenshot titled 'Bundesliga1'.

I had hoped to include an interactive menu where the user can switch between teams
within the Bundesliga and see their 'goals scored versus goals conceded'
from 2000 to 2008.

I had also hoped to include a separate visualistaion that shows a chosen teams every
result of a chosen year. It would've shown the 'Round'(e.g. week 1, week 2),
'Grounds'(i.e. Home or Away) and 'Result'(i.e. Win, Draw or Loss).
