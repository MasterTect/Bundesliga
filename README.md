# Bundesliga
Assignment1 for OOP 2015
Computer Science (International)

The CSV file contains the records of all games and their results in the
German Football League(Bundesliga) from 1963 to 2008.

I intend to manipulate this data so that it shows, year by year,
'goals scored versus goals conceded' by one of my favourite teams,
Borrusia Dortmund. This will be in line graph form.

I hope to include an interactive menu where the user can switch between teams
within the Bundesliga and see their 'goals scored versus goals conceded'
from 1963 to 2008.

I also hope to include a separate visualistaion that shows a chosen teams every
result of a chosen year. It will show the 'Round'(e.g. week 1, week 2),
'Grounds'(i.e. Home or Away) and 'Result'(i.e. Win, Draw or Loss).
